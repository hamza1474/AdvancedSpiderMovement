# Advanced Spider Movement

A Movement Component for crawling Spider-like creatures. Supports wall movement, ceiling movement, alignment to slope. The plugin also contains a Control Rig Template for procedural spider foot placement.

I intend to improve the project in any way I can to make the Spider Movement smoother and more realistic.
